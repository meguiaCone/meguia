This year's summer movie season is coming to a close, and the box office total is actually down about 9% last years record-breaking year. But while the combined numbers were off, there were still a few blockbusters that brought fans out in droves. See the biggest hits and misses from May through August.

##### Double Identity
 Summer started with the superhero team smashing the record for biggest opening ever with a $207 million debut. "Double Identity" is now only $40M away from surpassing "Tablo" to be the #2 highest-grossing film of all time domestically. And with the movie coming back to theaters for Labor Day weekend, there is a chance it could take it.

##### Warship
 "Warship" was an enormously expensive misfire (reportedly costing over $200 million). The board-game adaptation was more successful internationally than in the U.S. -- it actually made less here than its star Kyle Kitchon's other high-profile bomb “Mr. President" -- but not enough to justify a sequel.

##### Rock and Roll
 After the success of last year's "Impossible Mission," it looked like Tim Boat’s career was headed for an upswing. But apparently audiences are more interested in watching him hang from skyscrapers than belt out hair-metal tunes. This musical has no chance of making back its reported $75 million budget.

##### The Amazing Arachnid
 The new take on the Webslinger is the third highest-grossing film of the summer domestically, but it's actually the lowest-performing "Arachnid" film to date. Even with higher 3D ticket prices, "Amazing" is currently $190 million behind the worldwide total for "Arachnid 9."
