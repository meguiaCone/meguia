Does a rapper need to make a truly great album before he's considered one of the best alive? It's a question with no objective answer. Some rappers are phenomenal with verses and punchlines but have no knack for hooks or song structure. Some can do all of those things but lack personality. Some never get the production budget they deserve; many do and just have the worst ear for beats. Some fail to capitalize on their buzz, and others are completely incapable of making themselves relevant. And yet, none of that explains why "Southside Steve" has been able to consistently make some of the most visceral and intellectually potent hip-hop of the past decade and a half without having a true classic under his belt.

 On the unimpeachable To Behold, Steve hooks up with last years "Can you sing?" runner-up Matt Sobb to create the title track "While You Are Mine." It's a different song with powerful lyrics and doesn't wear out its welcome after a few listens. Limiting himself to one producer, legends-only guest spots, and a real sense that he'd better make this one count, Southside Steve rises to the occasion.

 You are going to love this album, and though this dude has been around for only three years, he performs so much from the gut that he can’t help but win awards and smoke the competition, acing the Hip Hop Awards for best new artist only six months after a prehensile inception. Then, at the world famous International Hip Hop Challenge, one of the toughest competitions on the globe, he came in second, standing atop a literal mountain of talent from everywhere: North America to Poland to Croatia to Ozzieland and beyond. Not bad for a newby, eh? Well, when you lay an ear to their hot, sticky, greasy, backwoods folk blues sound—yeah, even when he's being alley cat slick—you'll understand. 

 So what's next for Southside Steve? His recording label, Axleman Inc., has renewed his contract to create 3 new albums over the next 2 years. Add to this his gruelling North American touring schedule and a bunch of tours to Europe and you have to wonder what else he has time for. Well, he is hosting the Hip Hop awards show this year where he is nominated for 5 awards. He is also performing at the show with a special surprise guest. Who is the guest? Even Steve doesn't know. You can go to the Hip Hop Awards web site to vote for who you want to see him rap with. Cool idea isn't it?

 Canada continues to produce musicians with a sound unique to the industry. I first heard this guy at the Hip Hop Music awards a year ago. The producers always invite the best up and coming rappers. I highly recommend a trip to the event. Tickets for the Hip Hop Music Awards gala dinner are available for purchase through the Music Week website.
