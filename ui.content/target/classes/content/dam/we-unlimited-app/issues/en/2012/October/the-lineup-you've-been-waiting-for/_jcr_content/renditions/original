The annual Blues Festival was unfortunately cut short last year when a freak windstorm caused the main stage to collapse, injuring concertgoers and causing a couple of headliners to cancel their appearances. Event organizers have rebounded from the incident, however, having now announced the festival's triumphant return this year with a mighty lineup that includes The Sky Bombers, the Adventures, 2015, Iron Party, Hairy Puppets, MasterIAm and more.

 Organizers have just unveiled the first wave of performers that will make their way to the downtown stages between July 4 and 15.

 Some of the major acts also scheduled to appear include, The Beaton Boys, Conor, Billy Band, John F and the Dancing Monkeys, Alice Lefebvre, Scotty B, The Corporation, Snoop Catt, 1 Mill, The Shniders, David Brown, and The Rushtons.

 As the Blues Festival continues to pull away from its roots, the theme of this year's fest is "electro-fied," which will be reflected by sets from the Hodgson Thunder, Big Rig, AWOL, Paul and the Dudes, A-Train and the aforementioned The Sky Bombers.

 As for the homegrown talent, the Canadian contingent of the Blues Festival features acts such as The Town, Monkey Junk, Hey Mom, The Benny's, Red Rodeo, JoHo and the Gang, Flo Ryder,Â  TruckerMouth Will's, The Zyggs, Alexis, Where Am I?, and The Anthony's, among others.

 I attended this festival last year and I was blown away by the talent. Flo Ryder was a case in point, heading up a killer closing set at the opening night of the 14th annual Blues Festival on Friday evening.

 The man from Mississippi has an unassuming air about him until he hears that downbeat. Then his whole persona seems to subtlety shift, to take on something deeper, harder, tighter and louder.

 After the quick sound check and his introduction from festival co-producer, he walked out in his black leather blazer and jumped into the fray. Hunching over a bit, his hands cupped around a harmonica and microphone, he started blowing like a human blast-furnace, rocking forward and back as he wailed, spurred on by the tense grooves of his excellent backing band, and drummer Big Mike in particular.

 Most of the tunes were uptempo shuffles or boogie grooves, many of them from his last acclaimed autobiographical album, Will and I, starting with Rambler's Blues, a number that reflects on his own restless spirit.

 While Flo's harp remains the most thrilling tool in his expressive arsenal the man's grainy voice sounded in great shape too at 68, taking on just enough power to reach a low, throaty bellow on the chorus of a tune. A short, snappy take of Where Hwy 61 Runs continued on the travel theme before he took a trip even further back to the very beginning of his recording career.

 His return to this year's Blues Festival promises to be just as exciting.

 More artists are expected to be announced in the near future. But for now, you can get more artist information and tickets at the festival website or track them on Twitter for the latest updates.
